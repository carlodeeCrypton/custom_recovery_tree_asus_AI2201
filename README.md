  - USB/OTG doesn't work yet.
  - Data doesn't mount.
  - Also, Encrypted (but doesn't matter now, as data doesn't mount).

- What's working...
  - ABD now works, but MTP isn't stable due to /data not mounting.
  - Sideloading/Flashing .zip files.
  - Terminal/Console works fine.
  - Other features need more test.
